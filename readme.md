GraphQl in a nutshell

Query language implemented by Facebook team to improve performance of their
facebook mobile app by reducing an amount of request sent to a server
in order to get data.

There are lots of other cool things that GraphQl brings. I will not go through all of them, you can check them out on GraphQl official web page,
but we will touch some of them in code examples I have prepared for you.


Apollo in a nutshell is just a tool for working with GraphQl and unitilizing it's features,
it also bring other cool thing out-of-box such us data caching and state management, but I will not cover those things now.

It has client for a front-end with what you can send requests to your GraphQl back-end,
and it has a server which helps you to create your GraphQl back-end


Advantages of using GraphQl:

  And there only one endpoint that you send requests to. - Demo

  Strict types when creating a GraphQl scheme. - Demo

  With apollo-server we get a cool feature out-of-box to try out your GraphQl queries - Demo

  We only get a data we ask for, there is no need for impementing data transormers. - Demo
  
  ...and much more
